# Machine Learning

use and learn the machine learning

## Supervised Learning

used most wi

input -> output

learn to get **right answer**

eg. advertisement in big data(get the right click), self-driving car(to get the right position)

Regression belongs to it

x to y mapping

classification

## unsupervised learning

super than supervised learning

find something interesting in unlabeled data, for example to get different type(supervised group has told the type)

**Date only comes with input x, but not output labels y. Algorithm has to find structure in the data.**

Three main Type: 

1. Clustering

   Group similar data points together

2. Anomaly Detection(发现异常数据)

   Find unusual data points

3. Dimensionality Reduction(数据降维，减少无用参数)

   Compress data using fewer numbers
